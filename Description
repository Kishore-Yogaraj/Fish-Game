#Description
Hello User and welcome to Fish Game! A one player indie game with the objective to catch enough fish to reach the game win condition. You are a fisherman looking to find enough fish to feed your village by using bait, purchasing rods, and catching fish all based around probability.

#How to Play
You begin the game with 3 points and your first stop is the shop. In this shop you will have the opportunity to purchase different types of baits and rods which increase your probability of catching fish worth more points. BE AWARE! the waters you fish in are infested with sharks, jellyfish and eels who love the bait you use just as much as the fish. The higher the quality of bait, the higher the chance of being attacked by the hazards which depletes your points. The more fish you catch, the more points you get which can then be used to purchase higher quality bait and higher quality rods. A game of strategy, probability and luck.

How will you choose to fish?
